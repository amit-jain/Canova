## Note: As of July 2016, Canova has been deprecated, and has been replaced by [https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec](DataVec). DataVec includes all of the functionality from Canova, plus much more.
Other than the need to change some import statements, DataVec should be a drop-in replacement for Canova. The last release of Canova on Maven Central was 0.0.0.17.
